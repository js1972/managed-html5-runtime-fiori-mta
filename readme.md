## Diagram

![diagram](diagram.png)


## Description

This is an example of an SAP Fiori app that is managed by SAP Cloud Platform. The SAP Fiori app is exposed to an SAP Cloud Platform Launchpad and is visible in the content manager of the launchpad. The app is deployed to the HTML5 Application Repository and uses the Authentication & Authorization service (XSUAA service) and the destination service. 

The web app that is contained in the `HTML5Module-content.zip` defines the following (minimum) properties in the `manifest.json` file.

```JSON
{
  "sap.cloud": {
    "public": true,
    "service": "cloud.service"
  },
  "sap.app": {
    "id": "com.myorg.FLP",
    "applicationVersion": {
      "version": "1.0.0"
    }
  },
  "sap.ui5": {
    "dependencies": {
        "minUI5Version": "1.65.0"
    }
  }
}
```

This app includes a Fiori Elements app generated by fiori-tools in the HTML5Module folder.

The app can be run at design-time with:
```
npm start
```

## Requirements
- You have an SAP Cloud Platform trial account in the region Europe (Frankfurt). For creating the trial account, see this [tutorial](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/hcp-create-trial-account.html).
- Node.js LTS version 10 is installed: <https://nodejs.org/en/download>
- Cloud Foundry Command Line tool (cf CLI)  is installed. For more information, see this [tutorial](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-cf-download-cli.html)
- The Multi-Target Application Cloud Foundry CLI [Plugin](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/multiapps-cli-plugin) (MultiApps CF CLI Plugin) is installed : 
    ```
    cf add-plugin-repo CF-Community https://plugins.cloudfoundry.org
    cf install-plugin multiapps
    ```
- GNU Make : <https://www.gnu.org/software/make>

    If you are running macOS or Linux it's likely that you already have Make installed. As a Windows user, please use the [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) package manager to install [Make](https://chocolatey.org/packages/make) via `choco install make`. After the installation, please check you can start the executable (`make`) from the terminal.
    
## Download and Deployment
1. Subscribe to the [launchpad service](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-portal-cloud-foundry-getting-started.html) if you haven't done so before.
1. Download the source code:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/SAP-samples/multi-cloud-html5-apps-samples
    cd multi-cloud-html5-apps-samples/managed-html5-runtime-fiori-mta
    ```
2. Build the project:
    ```
    npm install
    npm run build
    ```
3. Deploy the project:
    ```
    npm run deploy:cf
    ```
    or
    ```
    cf deploy mta_archives/managed_fiori_1.0.0.mtar
    ```
4. Or build and deploy in one step:
    ```
    npm run deploy
    ```

*Note: Be careful that you do not already have a manually created destination with the same name that is dynamically created from the mta.yaml. If you do it will raise deploy with the destination service. This sample app uses a destination named `Northwind`*

If the deployment has been successful, you will be able to form the URL of the app based on the URL of launchpad. It will have the following structure: <https://[globalaccount-id].launchpad.cfapps.[region].hana.ondemand.com/cloudservice.comsapfioriapp/index.html#Shell-home>
